# Terra-ble
Terraform and ansible libraries and documentation

## This is a Terra-ble library

### Minimal instructions
Use `ansible/main.yml` as starting point, add or remove `import_playbook` directives at the top, you can delete the rest if you don't want to use any roles, otherwise you should probably change your target host/s, username etc and add or remove a role.  
If you don't know how to setup your `clouds.yml` and `hosts` file you should consult google and start learning.  
There is probably something useful in the readme files in each directory.

### Scope 
This library is a collection of terraform and ansible scripts that are useful enough for version control but not part of a bigger project. Some scripts can be universal and useful for anyone, other scripts may be very specialized and less useful for you.

### Submission guidelines
Each directory should have its own documentation with the basic commands and a description of what it is for.

### TODO
* There will be basic terraform and ansible documentation, but google is your best friend if something is missing or unclear.
