# Terra-ble
Terraform and ansible libraries and documentation

## This is a Terra-ble library
### Scope 
This library is a collection of terraform and ansible scripts that are useful enough for version control but not part of a bigger project. Some scripts can be universal and useful for anyone, other scripts may be very specialized and less useful for a basic usecase.

### Submission guidelines
Each directory should have its own documentation with the basic commands and a description of what it is for.

### TODO
* There will be basic terraform and ansible documentation, but google is your best friend if something is missing or unclear.
